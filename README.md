# Smart Desk System (Arduino)

This project is an Arduino-powered **Smart Desk System** that enhances productivity and health through automation and reminders.

## 🔧 Features

- 🌡️ **Temperature & Humidity Display** using DHT11
- ⏰ **Real-Time Clock** display via RTC DS1307
- 💡 **Ambient Light Detection** to turn on LEDs in low light
- 🚨 **Hydration Alert** with buzzer and LED when temperature exceeds 25°C
- 🔘 **Switch-controlled LED pattern**

## 🧩 Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- DHT11 Sensor
- RTC DS1307 Module
- LCD1602 Display
- Light Sensor (Photoresistor)
- Buzzer
- Push Button
- 4 LEDs
- Resistors, Jumper Wires, Breadboard

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The LCD shows current time, temperature, and humidity.
- If the surrounding light is low, an LED lights up and a buzzer sounds.
- If temperature exceeds 25°C, a hydration reminder is triggered.
- A push button cycles through LED lights in a pattern for additional visual feedback.


## 💡 Inspiration

This project was designed to encourage better habits and environment awareness while working at a desk.
